====================
While Unity itself is primarily C#-based, Python can be used for training AI models, preparing datasets, and potentially converting models into ONNX format for use in Unity. The actual Unity development (object detection in AR, mobile optimization, etc.) will be done in Unity and C#, but Python will play a key role in model development, dataset processing, and model conversion.

Here's a Python-focused outline for developing the AI models and converting them to ONNX for use in Unity Sentis:
Steps to Complete the Task:

    Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing
        Collect or generate a dataset with labeled data for interior objects (doors, windows, AC units).
        Preprocess the images for use in AI models.

    Model Training
        Use a deep learning framework (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) to train a model for object detection (YOLO or MobileNet).

    Model Conversion to ONNX
        After training the model, convert it to the ONNX format, which is compatible with Unity Sentis.

    Integration with Unity Sentis
        Unity will then use the ONNX model to detect objects in real-time during AR room scans.

Here’s a breakdown of how you can implement these steps in Python:
1. Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing

First, you need to gather and prepare a dataset of images for training the model. You would label the objects (e.g., door, window, AC unit) with bounding boxes. Once your dataset is ready, you can preprocess the images.

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Function to preprocess images (resize, normalize, etc.)
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    # Resize image to the required size (e.g., 224x224 for MobileNet)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    # Normalize the image (mean subtraction, scaling, etc.)
    image = image / 255.0
    return image

# Example of using the function
image = preprocess_image('path_to_image.jpg')

2. Model Training (Using YOLO or MobileNet)

Assuming you’re using a pre-trained MobileNet or YOLO model for object detection, here’s how you could set it up with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Using YOLO with PyTorch:

import torch
from torchvision import models, transforms

# Load a pre-trained YOLO model (for simplicity, you can use YOLOv5 here)
model = models.detection.yolov5(pretrained=True)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Define a transformation pipeline for preprocessing
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),  # Resize to match model input
])

# Apply transformation to an image
input_image = transform(image)
input_image = input_image.unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Run object detection
with torch.no_grad():
    detections = model(input_image)

# Print the detected objects (class labels, bounding boxes, scores)
print(detections)

3. Convert Model to ONNX

After training the model, you’ll want to convert it to the ONNX format so that it can be used in Unity. PyTorch makes this quite easy.

import torch.onnx

# Assuming 'model' is your trained model
# Dummy input for model trace (depends on your input size, e.g., (1, 3, 224, 224))
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Export model to ONNX
onnx_model_path = "model.onnx"
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, onnx_model_path, verbose=True)

This converts your trained PyTorch model to an ONNX model, which can be imported into Unity using Unity Sentis.
4. Integrating the ONNX Model with Unity Sentis

Once you have your model in ONNX format, you can integrate it with Unity. Unity Sentis allows you to run ONNX models directly. Here’s a basic outline of how you would set this up in Unity (using C#):

    Step 1: Import the ONNX model into Unity.
    Step 2: Use Unity Sentis to load the model and run inference.

Here is an example of how you might load and run an ONNX model in Unity using Unity Sentis (C# code):

using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Sentis;

public class ObjectDetection : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IModel model;

    void Start()
    {
        // Load the ONNX model
        model = ModelLoader.Load("path_to_model.onnx");
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Get image input (this can be from the AR camera)
        Texture2D cameraImage = GetCameraImage();

        // Convert camera image to input tensor
        var inputTensor = ConvertToTensor(cameraImage);

        // Run inference
        var outputTensor = model.Predict(inputTensor);

        // Process the output (detect objects)
        ProcessDetectionOutput(outputTensor);
    }

    Texture2D GetCameraImage()
    {
        // Your method to capture AR camera image
        return new Texture2D(224, 224);
    }

    Tensor ConvertToTensor(Texture2D image)
    {
        // Convert texture to tensor
        return new Tensor(image);
    }

    void ProcessDetectionOutput(Tensor output)
    {
        // Process the detected objects
        // (for example, bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores)
    }
}

Testing and Optimization

    Test your object detection system under different lighting conditions, room layouts, and object sizes.
    Optimize the performance for mobile devices (Android/iOS) by reducing model size, using quantization, or pruning the model for faster inference.

Conclusion

The Python code provided covers the AI model training, conversion to ONNX format, and preparation for integration with Unity. Unity will handle the AR aspects of the app, including real-time object detection. Make sure to test the system thoroughly to ensure smooth performance across different devices. This approach leverages Python for AI model development, while Unity Sentis takes care of the AR and real-time object detection.
